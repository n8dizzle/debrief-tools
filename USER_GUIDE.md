## For Dispatchers

Your main job is to debrief completed jobs by reviewing ticket details with the tech.

### The Queue
When you sign in, you'll see the **Queue** - a list of jobs waiting to be debriefed.

- **Pending** - Jobs ready for debrief
- **In Progress** - Jobs you've started but not finished

Click any job to open the debrief form.

### Completing a Debrief

For each job, you'll review and check off:

1. **Photos** - Did the tech upload photos?
2. **Invoice Summary** - Rate the quality (1-10)
3. **Payment** - Was payment collected?
4. **Estimates** - Were estimates offered/discussed?
5. **Membership** - Was membership offered?
6. **Google Reviews** - Were reviews discussed with customer?
7. **Replacement Discussion** - For older equipment, was replacement discussed?
8. **Equipment Added** - Was equipment added to the ST location?
9. **Materials on Invoice** - Did tech add all materials/equipment to the invoice? (Critical for gross margin!)
10. **G3 Contact** - Is a G3 contact needed?

For each item, select **Pass**, **Fail**, or **N/A** and add notes if needed.

### Follow-ups
If something needs attention (tech coaching, customer callback, etc.), check **Follow-up Required** and fill in the details. This sends a notification to Slack.

### Other Pages

- **Dashboard** - See completion stats and team performance
- **History** - Search and filter past debriefs
